# Cotrackot
A simple, 40 key, wireless, unibody with T460s Trackpoint compatibility named 'Cotrackot'.
Fell in love with Aki's 'Cocot46+' and it inspired me to design this keyboard.

Some details:
1. Choc v1 - Hotswap - MX spaced - index & inner-index columns set to ortholinear for ideal Trackpoint placement.
2. On/Off switch 'jumper on header style' - Placing the jumper over the left and middle pins connects the battery, placing it over the middle and right pins disconnects the battery.
3. 15Â° angle between the two sides.
4. Pins exposed for Trackpoint: VCC, GND, CLK (P0), DATA (P1), RST (P9).
5. Custom 3DP LDSA keycaps adjusted for MX spacing.
6. Custom 3DP Trackpoint extension pin optimized for FDM printing.
